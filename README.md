Fork of Deedy-Resume
=========================

A one-page, two asymmetric column resume written in **LaTeX** and compiled with **XeLaTeX**. 

Integrates font-awesome icons and **OpenFonts** - free, open source fonts that include the ones used in the OpenFonts folder - *Lato* and *Raleway*. 

## For LaTeX newbies:

1. Download either **MacTeX** or **BasicTeX*
2. Install package
3. Download **TexShop** for a generic TeX GUI (Tried using Sublime Text with LaTeXing but had issues)
4. Edit the *.tex* and *.cls* files. Refer to Extra for more information about these file types.
5. Compile by clicking on `Typeset` every time you want to compile into PDF.

# Extra
To my understanding, .tex file in web programming is like the HTML, while *.cls* file is like the CSS.
The difference is that you can create "components" in the *.cls* file that you can use in the *.tex* file.

:warning: To use Fontawesome icons, the FontAwesome TrueType font (included) must be installed and available to OSX.
